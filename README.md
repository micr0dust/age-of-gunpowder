The background of the game is set in the era of the transition from the Middle Ages to the line infantry period.
The invention of the musket allowed infantry to gradually replace cavalry into the mainstream on the battlefield.

Occupy more land to increase resource productivity, cut off the enemy's territorial connections to interrupt their supplies, and train your army to defeat the enemy.
