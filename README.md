The background of the game is set in the era of the transition from the Middle Ages to the line infantry period.
The invention of the musket allowed infantry to gradually replace cavalry into the mainstream on the battlefield.

Occupy more land to increase resource productivity, cut off the enemy's territorial connections to interrupt their supplies, and train your army to defeat the enemy. The game supports up to 4 players to play, you can play 1v1, 2v2, 1v3 (I donâ€™t think you would want to do this),1v1v2 or FFA, you can play with AI or players or mixed.
